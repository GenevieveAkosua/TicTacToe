# TicTacToe

### Description

This is a fun game of tic-tac-toe with two players: the user and the computer (i.e. a random number generator). This would be a fun game to AI-ify in the future, so that the computer can actually give you a hard time winning!

### What I used

This game was created using Java only. No special modules needed.

### Credits

I got this game from a YouTuber named [Coding with John](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROvAUVINlBE). I made a few changes to my code, so you can find the original source code is available in the video description.

This one isn't really challenging if you have a good Java foundation, but it is fun nonetheless. Right now, it runs in the terminal, but it could be placed in a GUI to make it more sophisticated.

Anyways, have fun!
